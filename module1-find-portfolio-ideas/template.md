# Ideas for data storytelling
### Jason Murphy
## You

What do you care about?
    IOT, Computer Vision, and Home Automation and Control.

What do you know about?
    Arduino, Raspberry PI, Linux, Fixing Microsoft Windows problems, and Project Management.

What decisions do you face?
    I have to choose how I can use what I know to create a compelling story with the data.

## topics
    I have already looked into these two and have the data on my local machine
        - Meteorite data from NASA.gov
            This data would make a great Geo Map timeline of where and what size the strikes have been found.
        - NYC CitiBike data that They post
            I found this data through NYC Open Data website.
            I think this would make a great visual of where bikes were checked out from and checked in to.
            I can also take this data, and pull out data based on age and gender breakdown.
            This data also gives bike ID's so I can find average hours on a bike before it is retired.
            There are a lot of things I can do with this Data, and it is updated every month.

    Topics that I haven't already looked at
        - 
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
    CitiBike data

2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?
    CitiBike

4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses
    CitiBike

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
    Citi Bike

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
I would think that there are certain assumptions on the age, gender and hours checked out 
that would be compiled from this data.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

    I don't have a single one, but I am compelled by the story and the use of visuals to aide in making the point.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
    I already got the data
